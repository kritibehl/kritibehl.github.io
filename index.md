### Human-Centered AI Researcher | LLM Evaluation | Multimodal Intelligence

Hi, I design evaluation and reasoning systems that make AI safer for humans.
My work focuses on intent-preserving repair, multimodal reasoning, and transparent model scoring.

## 🔥 Featured Work

### FairEval-Suite
**Human-Aligned Evaluation of Generative Models (beyond accuracy and toxicity).**
A lightweight scoring framework using:
- Helpfulness
- Relevance
- Clarity
- Transparent toxicity signals

### VoiceVisionReasoner
Multimodal reasoning across **Speech → Vision → Language**.
Transforms emotional human signals into collaborative problem solving.
- Speech transcription
- Visual grounding
- Joint reasoning
- Sanity + tone checks
