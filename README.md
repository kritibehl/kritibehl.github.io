# Kriti Behl

AI Safety and Multimodal Evaluation Engineer  
Computer & Information Science & Engineering, University of Florida

I design and build end-to-end AI systems focused on safety, multimodal reasoning, and human-aligned evaluation.  
My work spans benchmark design, inference pipelines, DevOps infrastructure, dashboards, and applied research.

## Flagship Projects

### FairEval-Suite
Human-aligned evaluation framework for generative models.  
Benchmarks on helpfulness, relevance, clarity, and toxicity, providing real-time scoring dashboards and model comparison.

Key results:
- Reduced hallucination error 17–26 percent vs prompt-based baselines
- Increased clarity scores by 18.9 percent on a controlled benchmark
- Unified scoring across frontier LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude, DeepSeek)

Stack: Python, FastAPI, MongoDB, Chart.js, pytest

### VoiceVisionReasoner
Multimodal reasoning engine combining speech, image, and human context.

Key results:
- Reduced indirect-speech misinterpretation by 35 percent
- Improved grounded-response F1 score by 22 percent
- Provides uncertainty-aware inference and reasoning trace

Stack: PyTorch, HuggingFace, OpenAI API, TorchVision  
Links: [GitHub](#) | [Demo](#)

---

### JailBreakDefense
LLM jailbreak detection and repair pipeline focused on preserving legitimate user intent.

Key results:
- Decreased false refusals by approximately 40 percent
- Reduced malicious compliance by more than 90 percent
- Increased preserved-intent quality by 31 percent

Stack: Python, Transformers, custom RepairEngine, Safety RAG

## Engineering and Infrastructure Projects

### AutoOps-Insight
CI/CD health and failure analytics platform supporting Jenkins and GitHub Actions.  
Log-driven insights, system metrics, and root-cause diagnostics via Prometheus and MongoDB.

### KubePulse
Kubernetes chaos engineering and monitoring platform.  
Injects controlled system stress and tracks real-time degradation using Prometheus and Grafana.

### Chrome Copilot
Browser extension for debugging logs and code using LLM inference.  
Focused on developer acceleration, error interpretation, and interactive analysis.
